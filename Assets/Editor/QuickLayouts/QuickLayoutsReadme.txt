CURRENT UPDATE (AS OF THIS README):
v1.0.2 - Nov/02/2014
FEATURE IMPROVEMENTS: 
- The QuickLayouts window can now be toggled on/off via [Ctrl/Cmd + ` ] rather than merely opening it.

BEHIND THE SCENES:
- Wrapped code into DLL.

PLANNED:
v1.1 - ETA November 2014
- Alternative "hotkeys exclusive to this project and save/load as such" mode.
- Alternative "use [Alt] [Shift] instead of [Ctrl/Cmd] as key modifier, or any combination of the three" mode.
- Hotkey activated layout banks with access to further keybindings.  (Provides a total 100 effective hotkeys -- 10 actual at one time -- by banking through pages of Layout hotkeys.)
________________________________________________

(1)		INSTALLATION
________________________________________________

1) Browse Unity's top menu bar to Window.

If you need a pointer on this, you can find it via the following:

File   Edit   Assets   GameObject   Component  *Window*   Help  (These options may vary depending on your currently imported assets and version of Unity.)


2) Browse to QuickLayouts.


3) Click upon 'Panel.'


4) Click "Save Settings".


DONE) QuickLayouts has been written to your computer's registry.  From here on out, any future reopening of this current project, via [File->Open Project], or, via a restarting of the Unity software, will NOT require steps 1-4 to be taken; your hotkey configuration will be live upon project load.

NOTE: This first-time initialization also extends to the import of QuickLayouts within other projects; your layout mappings will be live the moment QuickLayouts finishes importing in them, without need of repeating steps 1-4 within any other projects.

(2)		USAGE
________________________________________________

5) If not already available on-screen, open the QuickLayouts Panel via [Ctrl/Cmd + ` ].  

(The ` button is located directly above 'Tab' and to the left of '1', on a traditional keyboard.)  

NOTE: You can repeat steps 1-3 to access the Panel again, however, I'd strongly recommend accessing the Panel via this hotkey instead.


6) By default, three of Unity's stock Layouts have been defined for you.  Test this now by pressing Ctrl(Windows) or Cmd(Mac), in addition to either the '1', '2', or '3' button.


7) When satisfied, return to the QuickLayouts Panel.

8) Try replacing the text box labelled, by default, "Ctrl/Cmd + 4", with a Layout of your own.  If you need a reminder of what layouts you have, click on the dropdown panel at the very top-right corner of the Unity editor (located directly to the right of the "Layers" dropdown menu.)

NOTE: Layout names are case-sensitive.

9) Click Save Settings.

10)  Press [Ctrl/Cmd + 4].

DONE) Voila!  And this is the meat & potatoes of QuickLayouts.  Further instructions, at this point, cover optional features only.

(3)	ADVANCED USAGE
______________________________________________________


____________________________
(3a) FAST LAYOUT CREATION: |
____________________________|

a1) Choose a Layout you'd wish to use as a template.

a2) Launch said Layout.

a3) Press [Ctrl/Cmd + G] to open the Save Layout prompt.

a4) Begin typing a name for your new Layout and press [Enter]/[Return].

a5) Access the Panel.

a6) Tab down to, or click upon, the text box corresponding to the hotkey numeral you wish to assign your new Layout to.

a7) Type in the name of your new Layout.

a8) Press [Enter]/[Return] to confirm your input of text to the QuickLayouts Panel.

a8) Press Save Settings.

DONE) Utilize your new Layout via the hotkey you've assigned it to.

NOTE:  If Autosave is on, your new keymapping can be accessed during step 7.  Yes, that's right - step 7.  Your keymaps, with Autosave being enabled, are effective before you even finish typing them into the QuickLayouts panel.

____________________________
(3b) FAST LAYOUT UPDATING: |
____________________________|

b1) Choose a Layout you'd wish to update.

b2) Launch said Layout.

b3) Press [Ctrl/Cmd + G] to open the Save Layout prompt.

b4) Press [Enter]/[Return] to overwrite.

DONE) Your layout has been updated.  As a nifty aside, this will also update the Layout's current location of the Scene View, as well as the currently collapsed parent GameObjects in the Hierarchy.

NOTE: Such FAST LAYOUT updating makes it extremely useful to use your "Go-To" layouts across all projects, as updating the Layout will not overwrite the positions of windows, but will provide a project-sensitive "return" point for each of your Layouts when returning to them from other Layouts.

 REMAPPING |
____________________________|

*******************************************************
*** This technique requires Autosave to be enabled. ***
*******************************************************

c1) Open, or give focus to the Panel at any time via [Ctrl/Cmd + ` ] (if you need help finding it, see (1)USAGE step #3).

c2) Use the [Tab] key to access your desired text input field.

c3) Press return to activate said desired text input field.

c4) Type in the name of your desired Layout, without pressing [Enter]/[Return] to confirm.

c5) Press the corresponding hotkey combination.

c6) Provided you've successfully switched to this Layout, repeat steps (c1)-(c5) as many times until you are satisfied.  If the switch did NOT work, check your bottom status bar for an error.  You will be informed in either case of, not having bound a hotkey, or, no existing Layout by the inputted name.
